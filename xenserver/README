This directory contains files for seamless integration of Open vSwitch on
Citrix XenServer hosts managed by the Citrix management tools.

Files in this directory are licensed on a file-by-file basis.  Please
refer to each file for details.

Most of the files in this directory is installed on a XenServer system
under the same name, if underscores are replaced by slashes.  The
files are:

    etc_init.d_openvswitch

        Initializes Open vSwitch at boot and shuts it down at shutdown.

    etc_init.d_openvswitch-xapi-update

        Init script to ensure openvswitch-cfg-update is called for the
        current host at boot.

    etc_logrotate.d_openvswitch

        Ensures that logs in /var/log/openvswitch are rotated

    etc_xensource_bugtool_system-configuration_openvswitch.xml

        xen-bugtool extension to collect system configuration information
        relevant to Open vSwitch, including timezone.

    etc_xensource_scripts_vif

        Open vSwitch-aware replacement for Citrix script of the same name.

    openvswitch-xen.spec

        spec file for building RPMs to install on a XenServer host.

    opt_xensource_libexec_interface-reconfigure

        Open vSwitch-aware replacement for Citrix script of the same name.

    usr_share_openvswitch_scripts_ovs-xapi-sync

        Daemon to monitor the external_ids columns of the Bridge and
        Interface OVSDB tables for changes that require interrogating
        XAPI.

    usr_share_openvswitch_scripts_sysconfig.template

        Template for Open vSwitch's /etc/sysconfig/openvswitch 
        configuration file.

    usr_share_openvswitch_scripts_xen-bugtool-tc-class-show

        Script to dump tc class configuration for all network
        interfaces. Intended to be run by xen-bugtool via
        etc_xensource_bugtool_network-status_openvswitch.xml.

    usr_lib_xsconsole_plugins-base_XSFeatureVSwitch.py

        xsconsole plugin to configure the pool-wide configuration keys
        used to control Open vSwitch when integrated with Citrix 
        management tools.

    uuid.py

        This is uuid.py from Python 2.5.  It is installed into the
        Open vSwitch RPM because XenServer uses Python 2.4, which does
        not have uuid.py.

To install, build the Open vSwitch RPM with a command like this:

        rpmbuild -D "openvswitch_version $full_version" \
                -D "xen_version $XENKERNEL" \
                -D "build_number --with-build-number=$buildnr" \
                -bb openvswitch-xen.spec

Then, "rpm -U" the resulting Open vSwitch package on the XenServer hosts in
question and reboot them.  (The openvswitch-dbg package that is also
produced need not be installed, but it is harmless to do so.)
