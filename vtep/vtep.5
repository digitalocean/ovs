.SH "TABLE RELATIONSHIPS"
.PP
The following diagram shows the relationship among tables in the
database.  Each node represents a table.  Tables that are part of the
``root set'' are shown with double borders.  Each edge leads from the
table that contains it and points to the table that its value
represents.  Edges are labeled with their column names, followed by a
constraint on the number of allowed values: \fB?\fR for zero or one,
\fB*\fR for zero or more, \fB+\fR for one or more.  Thick lines
represent strong references; thin lines represent weak references.

SSL key and certificate configuration happens outside the

Maximum number of milliseconds of idle time on connection to the

the database server assumes the connection has been broken

.ST "Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD):"
BFD, defined in RFC 5880, allows point to point detection of
connectivity failures by occasional transmission of BFD control
messages. VTEPs are expected to implement BFD.
.PP
BFD operates by regularly transmitting BFD control messages at a
rate negotiated independently in each direction.  Each endpoint
specifies the rate at which it expects to receive control messages,
and the rate at which it\(cqs willing to transmit them.  An endpoint
which fails to receive BFD control messages for a period of three
times the expected reception rate will signal a connectivity
fault.  In the case of a unidirectional connectivity issue, the
system not receiving BFD control messages will signal the problem
to its peer in the messages it transmits.
.PP
A hardware VTEP is expected to use BFD to determine reachability of
devices at the end of the tunnels with which it exchanges data. This
can enable the VTEP to choose a functioning service node among a set of
service nodes providing high availability. It also enables the NVC to
report the health status of tunnels.
.PP
In most cases the BFD peer of a hardware VTEP will be an Open vSwitch
instance. The Open vSwitch implementation of BFD aims to comply
faithfully with the requirements put forth in RFC 5880.  Open vSwitch
does not implement the optional Authentication or ``Echo Mode\(cq\(cq
features.

.IP "\fBbfd : min_rx\fR: optional string, containing an integer, at least 1"

\fB1000\fR\.
.IP "\fBbfd : min_tx\fR: optional string, containing an integer, at least 1"
The shortest interval, in milliseconds, at which this BFD session is

transmitted at a slower rate if the remote endpoint is not willing to
receive as quickly as specified.  Defaults to \fB100\fR\.
.IP "\fBbfd : decay_min_rx\fR: optional string, containing an integer"
An alternate receive interval, in milliseconds, that must be greater
than or equal to \fBbfd:min_rx\fR\.  The
implementation switches from \fBbfd:min_rx\fR to \fBbfd:decay_min_rx\fR when there is no obvious incoming
data traffic at the interface, to reduce the CPU and bandwidth cost
of monitoring an idle interface.  This feature may be disabled by
setting a value of 0.  This feature is reset whenever \fBbfd:decay_min_rx\fR or \fBbfd:min_rx\fR

.IP "\fBbfd : forwarding_if_rx\fR: optional string, either \fBtrue\fR or \fBfalse\fR"
True to consider the interface capable of packet I/O as long as it

to be lost from marking the interface down.
.IP "\fBbfd : cpath_down\fR: optional string, either \fBtrue\fR or \fBfalse\fR"
Set to true to notify the remote endpoint that traffic should not be
forwarded to this system for some reason other than a connectivty

reason is ``concatenated path down,\(cq\(cq that is, that connectivity
beyond the local system is down.  Defaults to false.

to set the MAC used as destination for transmitted BFD packets and
expected as destination for received BFD packets.  The default is
\fB00:23:20:00:00:01\fR\.
.ST "BFD Status:"
The VTEP sets key-value pairs in the \fBbfd_status\fR
column to report the status of BFD on this interface.  When BFD is
not enabled, with \fBbfd:enable\fR, the switch clears
all key-value pairs from \fBbfd_status\fR\.
.IP "\fBbfd_status : state\fR: optional string, one of \fBdown\fR, \fBinit\fR, \fBup\fR, or \fBadmin_down\fR"
Reports the state of the BFD session.  The BFD session is fully
healthy and negotiated if \fBUP\fR\.
.IP "\fBbfd_status : forwarding\fR: optional string, either \fBtrue\fR or \fBfalse\fR"
Reports whether the BFD session believes this \fBPhysical_Locator\fR may be used to forward traffic.  Typically
this means the local session is signaling \fBUP\fR, and the
remote system isn\(cqt signaling a problem such as concatenated path
down.
.IP "\fBbfd_status : diagnostic\fR: optional string"
In case of a problem, set to a short message that reports what the
local BFD session thinks is wrong.
.IP "\fBbfd_status : remote_state\fR: optional string, one of \fBdown\fR, \fBinit\fR, \fBup\fR, or \fBadmin_down\fR"
Reports the state of the remote endpoint\(cqs BFD session.
.IP "\fBbfd_status : remote_diagnostic\fR: optional string"
In case of a problem, set to a short message that reports what the
remote endpoint\(cqs BFD session thinks is wrong.
