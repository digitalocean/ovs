.SH "Open_vSwitch DATABASE"
A database with this schema holds the configuration for one Open
vSwitch daemon.  The top-level configuration for the daemon is the
\fBOpen_vSwitch\fR table, which must have exactly one
record.  Records in other tables are significant only when they
can be reached directly or indirectly from the \fBOpen_vSwitch\fR table.  Records that are not reachable from
the \fBOpen_vSwitch\fR table are automatically deleted
from the database, except for records in a few distinguished
``root set\(cq\(cq tables noted below.

.SH "TABLE RELATIONSHIPS"
.PP
The following diagram shows the relationship among tables in the
database.  Each node represents a table.  Tables that are part of the
``root set'' are shown with double borders.  Each edge leads from the
table that contains it and points to the table that its value
represents.  Edges are labeled with their column names, followed by a
constraint on the number of allowed values: \fB?\fR for zero or one,
\fB*\fR for zero or more, \fB+\fR for one or more.  Thick lines
represent strong references; thin lines represent weak references.

.RE
.IP "\fBexternal_ids\fR: map of string-string pairs"
Key-value pairs for use by external frameworks that integrate
with Open vSwitch, rather than by Open vSwitch itself.  System
integrators should either use the Open vSwitch development
mailing list to coordinate on common key-value definitions, or
choose key names that are likely to be unique.  The currently
defined common key-value pairs are:
.RS
.TP
\fBsystem\-id\fR
A unique identifier for the Open vSwitch\(cqs physical host.
The form of the identifier depends on the type of the host.
On a Citrix XenServer, this will likely be the same as
\fBexternal_ids:xs-system-uuid\fR\.
.TP
\fBxs\-system\-uuid\fR
The Citrix XenServer universally unique identifier for the
physical host as displayed by \fBxe host\-list\fR\.
.RE
.ST "Status:"
.IP "\fBnext_cfg\fR: integer"
Sequence number for client to increment.  When a client modifies
any part of the database configuration and wishes to wait for
Open vSwitch to finish applying the changes, it may increment
this sequence number.
.IP "\fBcur_cfg\fR: integer"
Sequence number that Open vSwitch sets to the current value of
\fBnext_cfg\fR after it finishes applying a set of
configuration changes.
.IP "\fBcapabilities\fR: map of string-\fBCapability\fR pairs"
Describes functionality supported by the hardware and software platform
on which this Open vSwitch is based.  Clients should not modify this
column.  See the \fBCapability\fR description for defined
capability categories and the meaning of associated
\fBCapability\fR records.
.IP "\fBstatistics\fR: map of string-string pairs"
Key-value pairs that report statistics about a system running an Open
vSwitch.  These are updated periodically (currently, every 5
seconds).  Key-value pairs that cannot be determined or that do not
apply to a platform are omitted.
.IP
Statistics are disabled unless \fBother-config:enable-statistics\fR is set to \fBtrue\fR\.
.RS
.TP
\fBcpu\fR
Number of CPU processors, threads, or cores currently online and
available to the operating system on which Open vSwitch is
running, as an integer.  This may be less than the number
installed, if some are not online or if they are not available to
the operating system.
.IP
Open vSwitch userspace processes are not multithreaded, but the
Linux kernel-based datapath is.
.TP
\fBload_average\fR
A comma-separated list of three floating-point numbers,
representing the system load average over the last 1, 5, and 15
minutes, respectively.
.TP
\fBmemory\fR
A comma-separated list of integers, each of which represents a
quantity of memory in kilobytes that describes the operating
system on which Open vSwitch is running.  In respective order,
these values are:
.RS
.IP 1. .25in
Total amount of RAM allocated to the OS.
.IP 2. .25in
RAM allocated to the OS that is in use.
.IP 3. .25in
RAM that can be flushed out to disk or otherwise discarded
if that space is needed for another purpose.  This number is
necessarily less than or equal to the previous value.
.IP 4. .25in
Total disk space allocated for swap.
.IP 5. .25in
Swap space currently in use.
.RE
.IP
On Linux, all five values can be determined and are included.  On
other operating systems, only the first two values can be
determined, so the list will only have two values.
.TP
\fBprocess_\fR\fIname\fR
One such key-value pair will exist for each running Open vSwitch
daemon process, with \fIname\fR replaced by the daemon\(cqs
name (e.g. \fBprocess_ovs\-vswitchd\fR).  The value is a
comma-separated list of integers.  The integers represent the
following, with memory measured in kilobytes and durations in
milliseconds:
.RS
.IP 1. .25in
The process\(cqs virtual memory size.
.IP 2. .25in
The process\(cqs resident set size.
.IP 3. .25in
The amount of user and system CPU time consumed by the
process.
.IP 4. .25in
The number of times that the process has crashed and been
automatically restarted by the monitor.
.IP 5. .25in
The duration since the process was started.
.IP 6. .25in
The duration for which the process has been running.
.RE
.IP
The interpretation of some of these values depends on whether the
process was started with the \fB\-\-monitor\fR\.  If it
was not, then the crash count will always be 0 and the two
durations will always be the same.  If \fB\-\-monitor\fR
was given, then the crash count may be positive; if it is, the
latter duration is the amount of time since the most recent crash
and restart.
.IP
There will be one key-value pair for each file in Open vSwitch\(cqs
``run directory\(cq\(cq (usually \fB/var/run/openvswitch\fR)
whose name ends in \fB\.pid\fR, whose contents are a
process ID, and which is locked by a running process.  The
\fIname\fR is taken from the pidfile\(cqs name.
.IP
Currently Open vSwitch is only able to obtain all of the above
detail on Linux systems.  On other systems, the same key-value
pairs will be present but the values will always be the empty
string.
.TP
\fBfile_systems\fR
A space-separated list of information on local, writable file
systems.  Each item in the list describes one file system and
consists in turn of a comma-separated list of the following:
.RS
.IP 1. .25in
Mount point, e.g. \fB/\fR or \fB/var/log\fR\.
Any spaces or commas in the mount point are replaced by
underscores.
.IP 2. .25in
Total size, in kilobytes, as an integer.
.IP 3. .25in
Amount of storage in use, in kilobytes, as an integer.
.RE
.IP
This key-value pair is omitted if there are no local, writable
file systems or if Open vSwitch cannot obtain the needed
information.
.RE
.ST "Version Reporting:"
These columns report the types and versions of the hardware and
software running Open vSwitch.  We recommend in general that software
should test whether specific features are supported instead of relying
on version number checks.  These values are primarily intended for
reporting to human administrators.
.IP "\fBovs_version\fR: optional string"
The Open vSwitch version number, e.g. \fB1.1.0\fR\.
If Open vSwitch was configured with a build number, then it is
also included, e.g. \fB1.1.0+build6579\fR\.
.IP "\fBdb_version\fR: optional string"
The database schema version number in the form
\fB\fImajor\fB\.\fIminor\fB\.\fItweak\fB\fR,
e.g. \fB1.2.3\fR\.  Whenever the database schema is changed in
a non-backward compatible way (e.g. deleting a column or a table),
\fImajor\fR is incremented.  When the database schema is changed
in a backward compatible way (e.g. adding a new column),
\fIminor\fR is incremented.  When the database schema is changed
cosmetically (e.g. reindenting its syntax), \fItweak\fR is
incremented.
.IP
The schema version is part of the database schema, so it can also be
retrieved by fetching the schema using the Open vSwitch database
protocol.
.IP "\fBsystem_type\fR: optional string"
An identifier for the type of system on top of which Open vSwitch
runs, e.g. \fBXenServer\fR or \fBKVM\fR\.
.IP
System integrators are responsible for choosing and setting an
appropriate value for this column.
.IP "\fBsystem_version\fR: optional string"
The version of the system identified by \fBsystem_type\fR,
e.g. \fB5.6.100\-39265p\fR on XenServer 5.6.100 build 39265.
.IP
System integrators are responsible for choosing and setting an
appropriate value for this column.
.ST "Database Configuration:"
These columns primarily configure the Open vSwitch database
(\fBovsdb\-server\fR), not the Open vSwitch switch
(\fBovs\-vswitchd\fR).  The OVSDB database also uses the \fBssl\fR settings.
.PP
The Open vSwitch switch does read the database configuration to
determine remote IP addresses to which in-band control should apply.
.IP "\fBmanager_options\fR: set of \fBManager\fRs"
Database clients to which the Open vSwitch database server should
connect or to which it should listen, along with options for how these
connection should be configured.  See the \fBManager\fR table
for more information.
.bp
.SS "Bridge Table"
Configuration for a bridge within an
\fBOpen_vSwitch\fR\.
.PP

.ST "Core Features:"
.IP "\fBname\fR: string (must be unique within table)"
Bridge identifier.  Should be alphanumeric and no more than about 8
bytes long.  Must be unique among the names of ports, interfaces, and
bridges on a host.
.IP "\fBports\fR: set of \fBPort\fRs"
Ports included in the bridge.
.IP "\fBmirrors\fR: set of \fBMirror\fRs"
Port mirroring configuration.
.IP "\fBnetflow\fR: optional \fBNetFlow\fR"
NetFlow configuration.
.IP "\fBsflow\fR: optional \fBsFlow\fR"
sFlow configuration.
.IP "\fBflood_vlans\fR: set of up to 4096 integers, in range 0 to 4,095"
VLAN IDs of VLANs on which MAC address learning should be disabled, so
that packets are flooded instead of being sent to specific ports that
are believed to contain packets\(cq destination MACs.  This should
ordinarily be used to disable MAC learning on VLANs used for mirroring
(RSPAN VLANs).  It may also be useful for debugging.
.ST "OpenFlow Configuration:"
.IP "\fBcontroller\fR: set of \fBController\fRs"
OpenFlow controller set.  If unset, then no OpenFlow controllers
will be used.
.IP "\fBfail_mode\fR: optional string, either \fBsecure\fR or \fBstandalone\fR"
When a controller is configured, it is, ordinarily, responsible
for setting up all flows on the switch.  Thus, if the connection to
the controller fails, no new network connections can be set up.
If the connection to the controller stays down long enough,
no packets can pass through the switch at all.  This setting
determines the switch\(cqs response to such a situation.  It may be set
to one of the following:
.RS
.TP
\fBstandalone\fR
If no message is received from the controller for three
times the inactivity probe interval
(see \fBinactivity_probe\fR), then Open vSwitch
will take over responsibility for setting up flows.  In
this mode, Open vSwitch causes the bridge to act like an
ordinary MAC-learning switch.  Open vSwitch will continue
to retry connecting to the controller in the background
and, when the connection succeeds, it will discontinue its
standalone behavior.
.TP
\fBsecure\fR
Open vSwitch will not set up flows on its own when the
controller connection fails or when no controllers are
defined.  The bridge will continue to retry connecting to
any defined controllers forever.
.RE
.IP
If this value is unset, the default is implementation-specific.
.IP
When more than one controller is configured,
\fBfail_mode\fR is considered only when none of the
configured controllers can be contacted.
.IP "\fBdatapath_id\fR: optional string"
Reports the OpenFlow datapath ID in use.  Exactly 16 hex digits.
(Setting this column has no useful effect.  Set \fBother-config:datapath-id\fR instead.)
.ST "Other Features:"
.IP "\fBdatapath_type\fR: string"
Name of datapath provider.  The kernel datapath has
type \fBsystem\fR\.  The userspace datapath has
type \fBnetdev\fR\.
.IP "\fBexternal_ids\fR: map of string-string pairs"
Key-value pairs for use by external frameworks that integrate
with Open vSwitch, rather than by Open vSwitch itself.  System
integrators should either use the Open vSwitch development
mailing list to coordinate on common key-value definitions, or
choose key names that are likely to be unique.  The currently
defined key-value pairs are:
.RS
.TP
\fBbridge\-id\fR
A unique identifier of the bridge.  On Citrix XenServer this will
commonly be the same as
\fBexternal_ids:xs-network-uuids\fR\.
.TP
\fBxs\-network\-uuids\fR
Semicolon-delimited set of universally unique identifier(s) for
the network with which this bridge is associated on a Citrix
XenServer host.  The network identifiers are RFC 4122 UUIDs as
displayed by, e.g., \fBxe network\-list\fR\.
.RE
.IP "\fBother_config\fR: map of string-string pairs"
Key-value pairs for configuring rarely used bridge
features.  The currently defined key-value pairs are:
.RS
.TP
\fBdatapath\-id\fR
Exactly 16 hex
digits to set the OpenFlow datapath ID to a specific
value.  May not be all-zero.
.TP
\fBdisable\-in\-band\fR
If set to \fBtrue\fR, disable in-band control on
the bridge regardless of controller and manager settings.
.TP
\fBhwaddr\fR
An Ethernet address in the form
\fIxx\fR:\fIxx\fR:\fIxx\fR:\fIxx\fR:\fIxx\fR:\fIxx\fR
to set the hardware address of the local port and influence the
datapath ID.
.TP
\fBin\-band\-queue\fR
A queue ID as a nonnegative integer.  This sets the OpenFlow queue
ID that will be used by flows set up by in-band control on this
bridge.  If unset, or if the port used by an in-band control flow
does not have QoS configured, or if the port does not have a queue
with the specified ID, the default queue is used instead.
.TP
\fBflow\-eviction\-threshold\fR
A number of flows as a nonnegative integer.  This sets number
of flows at which eviction from the kernel flow table will
be triggered.
If there are a large number of flows then increasing this
value to around the number of flows present
can result in reduced CPU usage and packet loss.
.IP
The default is 1000.
.IP
Values below 100 will be rounded up to 100.

.SS "Port Table"
A port within a \fBBridge\fR\.
.PP
Most commonly, a port has exactly one ``interface,\(cq\(cq pointed to by its
\fBinterfaces\fR column.  Such a port logically
corresponds to a port on a physical Ethernet switch.  A port
with more than one interface is a ``bonded port\(cq\(cq (see
\fBBonding Configuration\fR).

.IP "\fBname\fR: string (must be unique within table)"
Port name.  Should be alphanumeric and no more than about 8
bytes long.  May be the same as the interface name, for
non-bonded ports.  Must otherwise be unique among the names of
ports, interfaces, and bridges on a host.
.IP "\fBinterfaces\fR: set of 1 or more \fBInterface\fRs"
The port\(cqs interfaces.  If there is more than one, this is a
bonded Port.
.ST "VLAN Configuration:"
A bridge port must be configured for VLANs in one of two
mutually exclusive ways:
.RS
.IP \bu
A ``trunk port\(cq\(cq has an empty value for \fBtag\fR\.  Its \fBtrunks\fR value may be
empty or non-empty.
.IP \bu
An ``implicitly tagged VLAN port\(cq\(cq or ``access port\(cq\(cq
has an nonempty value for \fBtag\fR\.  Its
\fBtrunks\fR value must be empty.
.RE
If \fBtrunks\fR and \fBtag\fR are both
nonempty, the configuration is ill-formed.
.IP "\fBtag\fR: optional integer, in range 0 to 4,095"
If this is an access port (see above), the port\(cqs implicitly
tagged VLAN.  Must be empty if this is a trunk port.
.IP
Frames arriving on trunk ports will be forwarded to this
port only if they are tagged with the given VLAN (or, if
\fBtag\fR is 0, then if they lack a VLAN header).
Frames arriving on other access ports will be forwarded to
this port only if they have the same \fBtag\fR
value.  Frames forwarded to this port will not have an
802.1Q header.
.IP
When a frame with a 802.1Q header that indicates a nonzero
VLAN is received on an access port, it is discarded.
.IP "\fBtrunks\fR: set of up to 4096 integers, in range 0 to 4,095"
If this is a trunk port (see above), the 802.1Q VLAN(s) that
this port trunks; if it is empty, then the port trunks all
VLANs.  Must be empty if this is an access port.
.IP
Frames arriving on trunk ports are dropped if they are not
in one of the specified VLANs.  For this purpose, packets
that have no VLAN header are treated as part of VLAN 0.
.ST "Bonding Configuration:"
A port that has more than one interface is a ``bonded port.\(cq\(cq Bonding
allows for load balancing and fail-over.  Some kinds of bonding will
work with any kind of upstream switch:
.RS
.TP
\fBbalance\-slb\fR
Balances flows among slaves based on source MAC address and output
VLAN, with periodic rebalancing as traffic patterns change.
.TP
\fBactive\-backup\fR
Assigns all flows to one slave, failing over to a backup slave when
the active slave is disabled.
.RE
.PP
The following modes require the upstream switch to support 802.3ad with
successful LACP negotiation.  If LACP negotiation fails then
\fBbalance\-slb\fR style flow hashing is used as a fallback:
.RS
.TP
\fBbalance\-tcp\fR
Balances flows among slaves based on L2, L3, and L4 protocol
information such as destination MAC address, IP address, and TCP
port.
.RE
.RS
.TP
\fBstable\fR
Attempts to always assign a given flow to the same slave
consistently.  In an effort to maintain stability, no load
balancing is done.  Uses a similar hashing strategy to
\fBbalance\-tcp\fR, always taking into account L3 and L4
fields even if LACP negotiations are unsuccessful.
.IP
Slave selection decisions are made based on \fBother_config:bond-stable-id\fR if set.  Otherwise,
OpenFlow port number is used.  Decisions are consistent across all
\fBovs\-vswitchd\fR instances with equivalent
\fBother_config:bond-stable-id\fR
values.
.RE
.PP
These columns apply only to bonded ports.  Their values are
otherwise ignored.
.IP "\fBbond_mode\fR: optional string, one of \fBactive\-backup\fR, \fBbalance\-tcp\fR, \fBbalance\-slb\fR, or \fBstable\fR"
The type of bonding used for a bonded port.  Defaults to
\fBbalance\-slb\fR if unset.
.IP "\fBbond_updelay\fR: integer"
For a bonded port, the number of milliseconds for which carrier must
stay up on an interface before the interface is considered to be up.
Specify \fB0\fR to enable the interface immediately.
.IP
This setting is honored only when at least one bonded interface is
already enabled.  When no interfaces are enabled, then the first bond
interface to come up is enabled immediately.
.IP "\fBbond_downdelay\fR: integer"
For a bonded port, the number of milliseconds for which carrier must
stay down on an interface before the interface is considered to be
down.  Specify \fB0\fR to disable the interface immediately.
.IP "\fBbond_fake_iface\fR: boolean"
For a bonded port, whether to create a fake internal interface with the
name of the port.  Use only for compatibility with legacy software that
requires this.
.IP "\fBlacp\fR: optional string, one of \fBactive\fR, \fBpassive\fR, or \fBoff\fR"
Configures LACP on this port.  LACP allows directly connected
switches to negotiate which links may be bonded.  LACP may be enabled
on non-bonded ports for the benefit of any switches they may be
connected to.  \fBactive\fR ports are allowed to initiate LACP
negotiations.  \fBpassive\fR ports are allowed to participate
in LACP negotiations initiated by a remote switch, but not allowed to
initiate such negotiations themselves. If unset Open vSwitch will
choose a reasonable default.
.ST "Other Features:"
.IP "\fBqos\fR: optional \fBQoS\fR"
Quality of Service configuration for this port.
.IP "\fBmac\fR: optional string"
The MAC address to use for this port for the purpose of choosing the
bridge\(cqs MAC address.  This column does not necessarily reflect the
port\(cqs actual MAC address, nor will setting it change the port\(cqs actual
MAC address.
.IP "\fBfake_bridge\fR: boolean"
Does this port represent a sub-bridge for its tagged VLAN within the
Bridge?  See ovs-vsctl(8) for more information.
.IP "\fBexternal_ids\fR: map of string-string pairs"
Key-value pairs for use by external frameworks that integrate with
Open vSwitch, rather than by Open vSwitch itself.  System integrators
should either use the Open vSwitch development mailing list to
coordinate on common key-value definitions, or choose key names that
are likely to be unique.
.IP
No key-value pairs native to \fBPort\fR are currently
defined.  For fake bridges (see the \fBfake_bridge\fR
column), external IDs for the fake bridge are defined here by
prefixing a \fBBridge\fR \fBexternal_ids\fR key with \fBfake\-bridge\-\fR,
e.g. \fBfake\-bridge\-xs\-network\-uuids\fR\.
.IP "\fBother_config\fR: map of string-string pairs"
Key-value pairs for configuring rarely used port features.  The
currently defined key-value pairs are:
.RS
.TP
\fBhwaddr\fR
An Ethernet address in the form
\fB\fIxx\fB:\fIxx\fB:\fIxx\fB:\fIxx\fB:\fIxx\fB:\fIxx\fB\fR\.
.TP
\fBbond\-rebalance\-interval\fR
For an SLB bonded port, the number of milliseconds between
successive attempts to rebalance the bond, that is, to
move source MACs and their flows from one interface on
the bond to another in an attempt to keep usage of each
interface roughly equal.  The default is 10000 (10
seconds), and the minimum is 1000 (1 second).
.TP
\fBbond\-detect\-mode\fR
Sets the method used to detect link failures in a bonded port.
Options are \fBcarrier\fR and \fBmiimon\fR\. Defaults
to \fBcarrier\fR which uses each interface\(cqs carrier to detect
failures.  When set to \fBmiimon\fR, will check for failures
by polling each interface\(cqs MII.
.TP
\fBbond\-miimon\-interval\fR
The number of milliseconds between successive attempts to
poll each interface\(cqs MII.  Only relevant on ports which use
\fBmiimon\fR to detect failures.
.TP
\fBbond\-hash\-basis\fR
An integer hashed along with flows when choosing output slaves.
When changed, all flows will be assigned different hash values
possibly causing slave selection decisions to change.
.TP
\fBlacp\-system\-id\fR
The LACP system ID of this \fBPort\fR\.  The system ID
of a LACP bond is used to identify itself to its partners.  Must
be a nonzero MAC address.
.TP
\fBlacp\-system\-priority\fR
The LACP system priority of this \fBPort\fR\.  In
LACP negotiations, link status decisions are made by the system
with the numerically lower priority.  Must be a number between 1
and 65535.
.TP
\fBlacp\-time\fR
The LACP timing which should be used on this
\fBPort\fR\.  Possible values are \fBfast\fR,
\fBslow\fR and a positive number of milliseconds.  By
default \fBslow\fR is used.  When configured to be
\fBfast\fR LACP heartbeats are requested at a rate of once
per second causing connectivity problems to be detected more
quickly.  In \fBslow\fR mode, heartbeats are requested at
a rate of once every 30 seconds.
.IP
Users may manually set a heartbeat transmission rate to increase
the fault detection speed further.  When manually set, OVS
expects the partner switch to be configured with the same
transmission rate.  Manually setting \fBlacp\-time\fR to
something other than \fBfast\fR or \fBslow\fR is
not supported by the LACP specification.
.TP
\fBlacp\-heartbeat\fR
Treats LACP like a simple heartbeat protocol for link state
monitoring.  Most features of the LACP protocol are disabled when
this mode is in use.

.IP "\fBmac\fR: optional string"
Ethernet address to set for this interface.  If unset then the
default MAC address is used:
.RS
.IP \bu
For the local interface, the default is the lowest-numbered MAC
address among the other bridge ports, either the value of the
\fBmac\fR in its \fBPort\fR record,

.ST "Ingress Policing:"
These settings control ingress policing for packets received on this
interface.  On a physical interface, this limits the rate at which
traffic is allowed into the system from the outside; on a virtual
interface (one connected to a virtual machine), this limits the rate at
which the VM is able to transmit.
.PP
Policing is a simple form of quality-of-service that simply drops
packets received in excess of the configured rate.  Due to its
simplicity, policing is usually less accurate and less effective than
egress QoS (which is configured using the \fBQoS\fR and \fBQueue\fR tables).
.PP
Policing is currently implemented only on Linux.  The Linux
implementation uses a simple ``token bucket\(cq\(cq approach:
.RS
.IP \bu
The size of the bucket corresponds to \fBingress_policing_burst\fR\.  Initially the bucket is full.
.IP \bu
Whenever a packet is received, its size (converted to tokens) is
compared to the number of tokens currently in the bucket.  If the
required number of tokens are available, they are removed and the
packet is forwarded.  Otherwise, the packet is dropped.
.IP \bu
Whenever it is not full, the bucket is refilled with tokens at the
rate specified by \fBingress_policing_rate\fR\.
.RE
.PP
Policing interacts badly with some network protocols, and especially
with fragmented IP packets.  Suppose that there is enough network
activity to keep the bucket nearly empty all the time.  Then this token
bucket algorithm will forward a single packet every so often, with the
period depending on packet size and on the configured rate.  All of the
fragments of an IP packets are normally transmitted back-to-back, as a
group.  In such a situation, therefore, only one of these fragments
will be forwarded and the rest will be dropped.  IP does not provide
any way for the intended recipient to ask for only the remaining
fragments.  In such a case there are two likely possibilities for what
will happen next: either all of the fragments will eventually be
retransmitted (as TCP will do), in which case the same problem will
recur, or the sender will not realize that its packet has been dropped
and data will simply be lost (as some UDP-based protocols will do).
Either way, it is possible that no forward progress will ever occur.
.IP "\fBingress_policing_rate\fR: integer, at least 0"
Maximum rate for data received on this interface, in kbps.  Data
received faster than this rate is dropped.  Set to \fB0\fR
(the default) to disable policing.
.IP "\fBingress_policing_burst\fR: integer, at least 0"
Maximum burst size for data received on this interface, in kb.  The
default burst size if set to \fB0\fR is 1000 kb.  This value
has no effect if \fBingress_policing_rate\fR
is \fB0\fR\.
.IP
Specifying a larger burst size lets the algorithm be more forgiving,
which is important for protocols like TCP that react severely to
dropped packets.  The burst size should be at least the size of the
interface\(cqs MTU.  Specifying a value that is numerically at least as
large as 10% of \fBingress_policing_rate\fR helps TCP come
closer to achieving the full rate.
.ST "Connectivity Fault Management:"
802.1ag Connectivity Fault Management (CFM) allows a group of
Maintenance Points (MPs) called a Maintenance Association (MA) to
detect connectivity problems with each other.  MPs within a MA should
have complete and exclusive interconnectivity.  This is verified by

configurable transmission interval.
.IP "\fBcfm_mpid\fR: optional integer, in range 1 to 8,191"
A Maintenance Point ID (MPID) uniquely identifies each endpoint within

CFM on this \fBInterface\fR\.
.IP "\fBcfm_remote_mpid\fR: optional integer, in range 1 to 8,191"

\fBPlease note:\fR Mirroring to a VLAN can disrupt a network that
contains unmanaged switches.  Consider an unmanaged physical switch
with two ports: port 1, connected to an end host, and port 2,
connected to an Open vSwitch configured to mirror received packets
into VLAN 123 on port 2.  Suppose that the end host sends a packet on
port 1 that the physical switch forwards to port 2.  The Open vSwitch
forwards this packet to its destination and then reflects it back on
port 2 in VLAN 123.  This reflected packet causes the unmanaged
physical switch to replace the MAC learning table entry, which
correctly pointed to port 1, with one that incorrectly points to port
2.  Afterward, the physical switch will direct packets destined for
the end host to the Open vSwitch on port 2, instead of to the end
host on port 1, disrupting connectivity.  If mirroring to a VLAN is
desired in this scenario, then the physical switch must be replaced
by one that learns Ethernet addresses on a per-VLAN basis.  In
addition, learning should be disabled on the VLAN containing mirrored
traffic. If this is not done then intermediate switches will learn
the MAC address of each end host from the mirrored traffic.  If
packets being sent to that end host are also mirrored, then they will
be dropped since the switch will attempt to send them out the input
port. Disabling learning for the VLAN will cause the switch to
correctly send the packet out all ports configured for that VLAN.  If
Open vSwitch is being used as an intermediate switch, learning can be
disabled by adding the mirrored VLAN to \fBflood_vlans\fR
in the appropriate \fBBridge\fR table or tables.

.SS "Controller Table"
An OpenFlow controller.
.PP
Open vSwitch supports two kinds of OpenFlow controllers:
.RS
.TP
Primary controllers
This is the kind of controller envisioned by the OpenFlow 1.0
specification.  Usually, a primary controller implements a network
policy by taking charge of the switch\(cqs flow table.
.IP
Open vSwitch initiates and maintains persistent connections to
primary controllers, retrying the connection each time it fails or
drops.  The \fBfail_mode\fR column in the
\fBBridge\fR table applies to primary controllers.
.IP
Open vSwitch permits a bridge to have any number of primary
controllers.  When multiple controllers are configured, Open
vSwitch connects to all of them simultaneously.  Because
OpenFlow 1.0 does not specify how multiple controllers
coordinate in interacting with a single switch, more than
one primary controller should be specified only if the
controllers are themselves designed to coordinate with each
other.  (The Nicira-defined \fBNXT_ROLE\fR OpenFlow
vendor extension may be useful for this.)
.TP
Service controllers
These kinds of OpenFlow controller connections are intended for
occasional support and maintenance use, e.g. with
\fBovs\-ofctl\fR\.  Usually a service controller connects only
briefly to inspect or modify some of a switch\(cqs state.
.IP
Open vSwitch listens for incoming connections from service
controllers.  The service controllers initiate and, if necessary,
maintain the connections from their end.  The \fBfail_mode\fR column in the \fBBridge\fR table does
not apply to service controllers.
.IP
Open vSwitch supports configuring any number of service controllers.

When multiple controllers are configured for a single bridge, the
\fBtarget\fR values must be unique.  Duplicate
\fBtarget\fR values yield unspecified results.
.IP "\fBconnection_mode\fR: optional string, either \fBin\-band\fR or \fBout\-of\-band\fR"
If it is specified, this setting must be one of the following
strings that describes how Open vSwitch contacts this OpenFlow
controller over the network:
.RS
.TP
\fBin\-band\fR
In this mode, this controller\(cqs OpenFlow traffic travels over the
bridge associated with the controller.  With this setting, Open
vSwitch allows traffic to and from the controller regardless of the
contents of the OpenFlow flow table.  (Otherwise, Open vSwitch
would never be able to connect to the controller, because it did
not have a flow to enable it.)  This is the most common connection
mode because it is not necessary to maintain two independent
networks.
.TP
\fBout\-of\-band\fR
In this mode, OpenFlow traffic uses a control network separate
from the bridge associated with this controller, that is, the
bridge does not use any of its own network devices to communicate
with the controller.  The control network must be configured
separately, before or after \fBovs\-vswitchd\fR is started.
.RE
.IP
If not specified, the default is implementation-specific.
.ST "Controller Failure Detection and Handling:"
.IP "\fBmax_backoff\fR: optional integer, at least 1,000"
Maximum number of milliseconds to wait between connection attempts.
Default is implementation-specific.
.IP "\fBinactivity_probe\fR: optional integer"
Maximum number of milliseconds of idle time on connection to
controller before sending an inactivity probe message.  If Open
vSwitch does not communicate with the controller for the specified
number of seconds, it will send a probe.  If a response is not
received for the same additional amount of time, Open vSwitch
assumes the connection has been broken and attempts to reconnect.
Default is implementation-specific.  A value of 0 disables
inactivity probes.
.ST "OpenFlow Rate Limiting:"
.IP "\fBcontroller_rate_limit\fR: optional integer, at least 100"
The maximum rate at which packets in unknown flows will be
forwarded to the OpenFlow controller, in packets per second.  This
feature prevents a single bridge from overwhelming the controller.
If not specified, the default is implementation-specific.
.IP
In addition, when a high rate triggers rate-limiting, Open
vSwitch queues controller packets for each port and transmits
them to the controller at the configured rate.  The number of
queued packets is limited by
the \fBcontroller_burst_limit\fR value.  The packet
queue is shared fairly among the ports on a bridge.
.IP
Open
vSwitch maintains two such packet rate-limiters per bridge.
One of these applies to packets sent up to the controller
because they do not correspond to any flow.  The other applies
to packets sent up to the controller by request through flow
actions. When both rate-limiters are filled with packets, the
actual rate that packets are sent to the controller is up to
twice the specified rate.
.IP "\fBcontroller_burst_limit\fR: optional integer, at least 25"
In conjunction with \fBcontroller_rate_limit\fR,
the maximum number of unused packet credits that the bridge will
allow to accumulate, in packets.  If not specified, the default
is implementation-specific.
.ST "Additional In-Band Configuration:"
These values are considered only in in-band control mode (see
\fBconnection_mode\fR).
.PP
When multiple controllers are configured on a single bridge, there
should be only one set of unique values in these columns.  If different
values are set for these columns in different controllers, the effect
is unspecified.
.IP "\fBlocal_ip\fR: optional string"
The IP address to configure on the local port,
e.g. \fB192.168.0.123\fR\.  If this value is unset, then
\fBlocal_netmask\fR and \fBlocal_gateway\fR are
ignored.
.IP "\fBlocal_netmask\fR: optional string"
The IP netmask to configure on the local port,
e.g. \fB255.255.255.0\fR\.  If \fBlocal_ip\fR is set
but this value is unset, then the default is chosen based on whether
the IP address is class A, B, or C.
.IP "\fBlocal_gateway\fR: optional string"
The IP address of the gateway to configure on the local port, as a
string, e.g. \fB192.168.0.1\fR\.  Leave this column unset if
this network has no gateway.

.IP "\fBprivate_key\fR: string"
Name of a PEM file containing the private key used as the switch\(cqs
identity for SSL connections to the controller.
.IP "\fBcertificate\fR: string"
Name of a PEM file containing a certificate, signed by the
certificate authority (CA) used by the controller and manager,
that certifies the switch\(cqs private key, identifying a trustworthy
switch.
.IP "\fBca_cert\fR: string"
Name of a PEM file containing the CA certificate used to verify
that the switch is connected to a trustworthy controller.
.IP "\fBbootstrap_ca_cert\fR: boolean"
If set to \fBtrue\fR, then Open vSwitch will attempt to
obtain the CA certificate from the controller on its first SSL
connection and save it to the named PEM file. If it is successful,
it will immediately drop the connection and reconnect, and from then
on all SSL connections must be authenticated by a certificate signed
by the CA certificate thus obtained.  \fBThis option exposes the
SSL connection to a man\-in\-the\-middle attack obtaining the initial
CA certificate.\fR  It may still be useful for bootstrapping.
.IP "\fBexternal_ids\fR: map of string-string pairs"
Key-value pairs for use by external frameworks that integrate with Open
vSwitch, rather than by Open vSwitch itself.  System integrators should
either use the Open vSwitch development mailing list to coordinate on
common key-value definitions, or choose key names that are likely to be
unique.  No common key-value pairs are currently defined.

.IP "\fBagent\fR: optional string"
Name of the network device whose IP address should be reported as the
``agent address\(cq\(cq to collectors.  If not specified, the IP address
defaults to the \fBlocal_ip\fR in the
collector\(cqs \fBController\fR\.  If an agent IP address cannot be
determined either way, sFlow is disabled.
.IP "\fBheader\fR: optional integer"
Number of bytes of a sampled packet to send to the collector.
If not specified, the default is 128 bytes.
.IP "\fBpolling\fR: optional integer"
Polling rate in seconds to send port statistics to the collector.
If not specified, defaults to 30 seconds.
.IP "\fBsampling\fR: optional integer"
Rate at which packets should be sampled and sent to the collector.
If not specified, defaults to 400, which means one out of 400
packets, on average, will be sent to the collector.
.IP "\fBtargets\fR: set of 1 or more strings"
sFlow targets in the form
\fB\fIip\fB:\fIport\fB\fR\.

Key-value pairs for use by external frameworks that integrate with Open

.SS "Capability Table"
Records in this table describe functionality supported by the hardware
and software platform on which this Open vSwitch is based.  Clients
should not modify this table.
.PP
A record in this table is meaningful only if it is referenced by the
\fBcapabilities\fR column in the
\fBOpen_vSwitch\fR table.  The key used to reference it, called
the record\(cqs ``category,\(cq\(cq determines the meanings of the
\fBdetails\fR column.  The following general forms of
categories are currently defined:
.RS
.TP
\fBqos\-\fItype\fB\fR
\fItype\fR is supported as the value for
\fBtype\fR in the \fBQoS\fR table.

.IP "\fBdetails\fR: map of string-string pairs"
Key-value pairs that describe capabilities.  The meaning of the pairs
depends on the category key that the \fBcapabilities\fR column in the \fBOpen_vSwitch\fR table
uses to reference this record, as described above.
.IP
The presence of a record for category \fBqos\-\fItype\fB\fR
indicates that the switch supports \fItype\fR as the value of
the \fBtype\fR column in the \fBQoS\fR
table.  The following key-value pairs are defined to further describe
QoS capabilities:
.RS
.TP
\fBn\-queues\fR
Number of supported queues, as a positive integer.  Keys in the
\fBqueues\fR column for \fBQoS\fR
records whose \fBtype\fR value
equals \fItype\fR must range between 0 and this value minus one,
inclusive.
