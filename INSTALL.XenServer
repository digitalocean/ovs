           How to Install Open vSwitch on Citrix XenServer
           ===============================================

This document describes how to build and install Open vSwitch on a
Citrix XenServer host.  If you want to install Open vSwitch on a
generic Linux host, see INSTALL.Linux instead.

These instructions have been tested with XenServer 5.6 FP1.

Building Open vSwitch for XenServer
-----------------------------------

The recommended build environment to build RPMs for Citrix XenServer
is the DDK VM available from Citrix.  If you are building from an Open
vSwitch distribution tarball, this VM has all the tools that you will
need.  If you are building from an Open vSwitch Git tree, then you
will need to first create a distribution tarball elsewhere, by running
"./boot.sh; ./configure; make dist" in the Git tree, because the DDK
VM does not include Autoconf or Automake that are required to
bootstrap the Open vSwitch distribution.

Once you have a distribution tarball, copy it into
/usr/src/redhat/SOURCES inside the VM.  Then execute the following:

   VERSION=<Open vSwitch version>
   KERNEL_NAME=<Xen Kernel name>
   KERNEL_VERSION=<Xen Kernel version>
   KERNEL_FLAVOR=<Xen Kernel flavor(suffix) >
   cd /tmp
   tar xfz /usr/src/redhat/SOURCES/openvswitch-$VERSION.tar.gz
   rpmbuild \
        -D "openvswitch_version $VERSION" \
        -D "kernel_name $KERNEL_NAME" \
        -D "kernel_version $KERNEL_VERSION" \
        -D "kernel_flavor $KERNEL_FLAVOR" \
        -bb openvswitch-$VERSION/xenserver/openvswitch-xen.spec

where:

    <openvswitch version> is the version number that appears in the
    name of the Open vSwitch tarball, e.g. 0.90.0.

    <Xen Kernel name> is the name of the Xen Kernel,
    e.g. kernel-xen or kernel-NAME-xen. By convention, the name
    starts with "kernel-" and ends with "-xen".
    This can be obtained by executing 
        'rpm -q --queryformat "%{Name}" kernel.*xen'
    with the "kernel-" stripped out using  sed 's/kernel-//'
    e.g. kernel-NAME-xen => NAME-xen

    <Xen Kernel version> is the output of:
    rpm -q --queryformat "%{Version}-%{Release}" kernel.*xen-devel
    e.g. 2.6.32.12-0.7.1.xs5.6.100.323.170596

    <Xen Kernel flavor (suffix) > is either "xen" or "kdump".
    The "xen" flavor is the main running kernel flavor and the "kdump" flavor is
    the crashdump kernel flavor. Commonly, one would specify "xen" here.

Three RPMs will be output into /usr/src/redhat/RPMS/i386, whose names begin
with "openvswitch", "openvswitch-modules-xen" (if building for kernel_flavor=xen),
and "openvswitch-debuginfo".

Installing Open vSwitch for XenServer
-------------------------------------

To install Open vSwitch on a XenServer host, or to upgrade to a newer version,
copy the "openvswitch" and "openvswitch-modules-xen" RPMs to that host with
"scp", then install them with "rpm -U", e.g.:

     scp openvswitch-$VERSION-1.i386.rpm \
         openvswitch-modules-xen-$XEN_KERNEL_VERSION-$VERSION-1.i386.rpm \
         root@<host>:
(At this point you will have to enter <host>'s root password.)
     ssh root@<host>
(At this point you will have to enter <host>'s root password again.)
     rpm -U openvswitch-$VERSION-1.i386.rpm \
         openvswitch-modules-xen-$XEN_KERNEL_VERSION-$VERSION-1.i386.rpm

To uninstall Open vSwitch from a XenServer host, remove the packages:

     ssh root@<host>
(At this point you will have to enter <host>'s root password again.)
     rpm -e openvswitch openvswitch-modules-xen-$XEN_KERNEL_VERSION

After installing or uninstalling Open vSwitch, the XenServer should be
rebooted as soon as possible.
