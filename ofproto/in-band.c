VLOG_DEFINE_THIS_MODULE(in_band)

/* In-band control allows a single network to be used for OpenFlow
 * traffic and other data traffic.  Refer to ovs-vswitchd.conf(5) and
 * secchan(8) for a description of configuring in-band control.
 *
 * This comment is an attempt to describe how in-band control works at a
 * wire- and implementation-level.  Correctly implementing in-band
 * control has proven difficult due to its many subtleties, and has thus
 * gone through many iterations.  Please read through and understand the
 * reasoning behind the chosen rules before making modifications.
 *
 * In Open vSwitch, in-band control is implemented as "hidden" flows (in that
 * they are not visible through OpenFlow) and at a higher priority than
 * wildcarded flows can be set up by through OpenFlow.  This is done so that
 * the OpenFlow controller cannot interfere with them and possibly break
 * connectivity with its switches.  It is possible to see all flows, including
 * in-band ones, with the ovs-appctl "bridge/dump-flows" command.
 *
 * The Open vSwitch implementation of in-band control can hide traffic to
 * arbitrary "remotes", where each remote is one TCP port on one IP address.
 * Currently the remotes are automatically configured as the in-band OpenFlow
 * controllers plus the OVSDB managers, if any.  (The latter is a requirement
 * because OVSDB managers are responsible for configuring OpenFlow controllers,
 * so if the manager cannot be reached then OpenFlow cannot be reconfigured.)
 *
 * The following rules (with the OFPP_NORMAL action) are set up on any bridge
 * that has any remotes:
 *
 *    (a) DHCP requests sent from the local port.
 *    (b) ARP replies to the local port's MAC address.
 *    (c) ARP requests from the local port's MAC address.
 *
 * In-band also sets up the following rules for each unique next-hop MAC
 * address for the remotes' IPs (the "next hop" is either the remote
 * itself, if it is on a local subnet, or the gateway to reach the remote):
 *
 *    (d) ARP replies to the next hop's MAC address.
 *    (e) ARP requests from the next hop's MAC address.
 *
 * In-band also sets up the following rules for each unique remote IP address:
 *
 *    (f) ARP replies containing the remote's IP address as a target.
 *    (g) ARP requests containing the remote's IP address as a source.
 *
 * In-band also sets up the following rules for each unique remote (IP,port)
 * pair:
 *
 *    (h) TCP traffic to the remote's IP and port.
 *    (i) TCP traffic from the remote's IP and port.
 *
 * The goal of these rules is to be as narrow as possible to allow a
 * switch to join a network and be able to communicate with the
 * remotes.  As mentioned earlier, these rules have higher priority
 * than the controller's rules, so if they are too broad, they may
 * prevent the controller from implementing its policy.  As such,
 * in-band actively monitors some aspects of flow and packet processing
 * so that the rules can be made more precise.
 *
 * In-band control monitors attempts to add flows into the datapath that
 * could interfere with its duties.  The datapath only allows exact
 * match entries, so in-band control is able to be very precise about
 * the flows it prevents.  Flows that miss in the datapath are sent to
 * userspace to be processed, so preventing these flows from being
 * cached in the "fast path" does not affect correctness.  The only type
 * of flow that is currently prevented is one that would prevent DHCP
 * replies from being seen by the local port.  For example, a rule that
 * forwarded all DHCP traffic to the controller would not be allowed,
 * but one that forwarded to all ports (including the local port) would.
 *
 * As mentioned earlier, packets that miss in the datapath are sent to
 * the userspace for processing.  The userspace has its own flow table,
 * the "classifier", so in-band checks whether any special processing
 * is needed before the classifier is consulted.  If a packet is a DHCP
 * response to a request from the local port, the packet is forwarded to
 * the local port, regardless of the flow table.  Note that this requires
 * L7 processing of DHCP replies to determine whether the 'chaddr' field
 * matches the MAC address of the local port.
 *
 * It is interesting to note that for an L3-based in-band control
 * mechanism, the majority of rules are devoted to ARP traffic.  At first
 * glance, some of these rules appear redundant.  However, each serves an
 * important role.  First, in order to determine the MAC address of the
 * remote side (controller or gateway) for other ARP rules, we must allow
 * ARP traffic for our local port with rules (b) and (c).  If we are
 * between a switch and its connection to the remote, we have to
 * allow the other switch's ARP traffic to through.  This is done with
 * rules (d) and (e), since we do not know the addresses of the other
 * switches a priori, but do know the remote's or gateway's.  Finally,
 * if the remote is running in a local guest VM that is not reached
 * through the local port, the switch that is connected to the VM must
 * allow ARP traffic based on the remote's IP address, since it will
 * not know the MAC address of the local port that is sending the traffic
 * or the MAC address of the remote in the guest VM.
 *
 * With a few notable exceptions below, in-band should work in most
 * network setups.  The following are considered "supported' in the
 * current implementation:
 *
 *    - Locally Connected.  The switch and remote are on the same
 *      subnet.  This uses rules (a), (b), (c), (h), and (i).
 *
 *    - Reached through Gateway.  The switch and remote are on
 *      different subnets and must go through a gateway.  This uses
 *      rules (a), (b), (c), (h), and (i).
 *
 *    - Between Switch and Remote.  This switch is between another
 *      switch and the remote, and we want to allow the other
 *      switch's traffic through.  This uses rules (d), (e), (h), and
 *      (i).  It uses (b) and (c) indirectly in order to know the MAC
 *      address for rules (d) and (e).  Note that DHCP for the other
 *      switch will not work unless an OpenFlow controller explicitly lets this
 *      switch pass the traffic.
 *
 *    - Between Switch and Gateway.  This switch is between another
 *      switch and the gateway, and we want to allow the other switch's
 *      traffic through.  This uses the same rules and logic as the
 *      "Between Switch and Remote" configuration described earlier.
 *
 *    - Remote on Local VM.  The remote is a guest VM on the
 *      system running in-band control.  This uses rules (a), (b), (c),
 *      (h), and (i).
 *
 *    - Remote on Local VM with Different Networks.  The remote
 *      is a guest VM on the system running in-band control, but the
 *      local port is not used to connect to the remote.  For
 *      example, an IP address is configured on eth0 of the switch.  The
 *      remote's VM is connected through eth1 of the switch, but an
 *      IP address has not been configured for that port on the switch.
 *      As such, the switch will use eth0 to connect to the remote,
 *      and eth1's rules about the local port will not work.  In the
 *      example, the switch attached to eth0 would use rules (a), (b),
 *      (c), (h), and (i) on eth0.  The switch attached to eth1 would use
 *      rules (f), (g), (h), and (i).
 *
 * The following are explicitly *not* supported by in-band control:
 *
 *    - Specify Remote by Name.  Currently, the remote must be
 *      identified by IP address.  A naive approach would be to permit
 *      all DNS traffic.  Unfortunately, this would prevent the
 *      controller from defining any policy over DNS.  Since switches
 *      that are located behind us need to connect to the remote,
 *      in-band cannot simply add a rule that allows DNS traffic from
 *      the local port.  The "correct" way to support this is to parse
 *      DNS requests to allow all traffic related to a request for the
 *      remote's name through.  Due to the potential security
 *      problems and amount of processing, we decided to hold off for
 *      the time-being.
 *
 *    - Differing Remotes for Switches.  All switches must know
 *      the L3 addresses for all the remotes that other switches
 *      may use, since rules need to be set up to allow traffic related
 *      to those remotes through.  See rules (f), (g), (h), and (i).
 *
 *    - Differing Routes for Switches.  In order for the switch to
 *      allow other switches to connect to a remote through a
 *      gateway, it allows the gateway's traffic through with rules (d)
 *      and (e).  If the routes to the remote differ for the two
 *      switches, we will not know the MAC address of the alternate
 *      gateway.
