  [ Open vSwitch team ]
  * New upstream version
    - Ability to define policies over IPv6
    - LACP
    - 802.1ag CCM
    - Support for extensible match extensions to OpenFlow
    - QoS:
      - Support for HFSC qdisc.
      - Queue used by in-band control can now be configured.
    - Kernel:
      - Kernel<->userspace interface has been reworked and should be
        close to a stable ABI now.
      - "Port group" concept has been dropped.
    - GRE over IPSEC tunnels
    - Bonding:
      - New active backup bonding mode.
      - New L4 hashing support when LACP is enabled.
      - Source MAC hash now includes VLAN field also.
      - miimon support.
    - Greatly improved handling of large flow tables
    - ovs-dpctl:
      - "show" command now prints full vport configuration.
      - "dump-groups" command removed since kernel support for
        port groups was dropped.
    - ovs-vsctl:
      - New commands for working with the new Managers table.
      - "list" command enhanced with new formatting options and --columns
        option.
      - "get" command now accepts new --id option.
      - New "find" command.
    - ovs-ofctl:
      - New "queue-stats" command for printing queue stats.
      - New commands "replace-flows" and "diff-flows".
      - Commands to add and remove flows can now read from files.
      - New --flow-format option to enable or disable NXM.
      - New --more option to increase OpenFlow message verbosity.
      - Removed "tun-cookie" command, which is no longer useful.
    - ovs-controller enhancements for testing various features.
    - New ovs-vlan-test command for testing for Linux kernel driver VLAN
      bugs.  New ovs-vlan-bug-workaround command for enabling and
      disabling a workaround for these driver bugs.
    - OpenFlow support:
      - "Resubmit" actions now update flow statistics. 
      - New "register" extension for use in matching and actions, via NXM.
      - New "multipath" experimental action extension.
      - New support for matching multicast Ethernet frames, via NXM.
      - New extension for OpenFlow vendor error codes.
      - New extension to set the QoS output queue without actually
        sending to an output port.
      - Open vSwitch now reports a single flow table, instead of
        separate hash and wildcard tables.  This better models the
        current implementation.
      - New experimental "note" action.
      - New "ofproto/trace" ovs-appctl command and associated utilities
        to ease debugging complex flow tables.
    - Database:
      - Schema documentation now includes an entity-relationship diagram.
      - The database is now garbage collected.  In most tables,
        unreferenced rows will be deleted automatically.
      - Many tables now include statistics updated periodically by
        ovs-vswitchd or ovsdb-server.
      - Every table now has an "external-ids" column for use by OVS
        integrators.
      - There is no default controller anymore.  Each bridge must have its
        controller individually specified.
      - The "fail-mode" is now a property of a Bridge instead of a Controller.
      - New versioning and checksum features.
      - New Managers table and manager_options column in Open_vSwitch table
        for specifying managers.  The old "managers" column in the
        Open_vSwitch table has been removed.
      - Many "name" columns are now immutable.
    - Feature removals:
      - Dropped support for XenServer pre-5.6.100.
      - Dropped support for Linux pre-2.6.18.
      - Dropped controller discovery support.
      - Dropped "ovs-ofctl status" and the OpenFlow extension that it used.
        Statistics reporting in the database is a rough equivalent.
      - Dropped the "corekeeper" package (now separate, at
        http://openvswitch.org/cgi-bin/gitweb.cgi?p=corekeeper).
    - Performance and scalability improvements
    - Bug fixes
