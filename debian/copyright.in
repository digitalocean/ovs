  The exception clause pre-amble reads:

  As a special exception to the GNU Lesser General Public License, you
  may link, statically or dynamically, a "work that uses the Library"
  with a publicly distributed version of the Library to produce an
  executable file containing portions of the Library, and distribute
  that executable file under terms of your choice, without any of the
  additional requirements listed in clause 6 of the GNU Lesser General
  Public License.  By "a publicly distributed version of the Library",
  we mean either the unmodified Library as distributed, or a
  modified version of the Library that is distributed under the
  conditions defined in clause 3 of the GNU Library General Public
  License.  This exception does not however invalidate any other reasons
  why the executable file might be covered by the GNU Lesser General
  Public License.
